            Ever wondered why few websites stand out and few don't? Even if the latter provides more functionality and great content your brain still tend to drive towards the prior website/app. 
            <br/><br/>This is because of the extensiveness of intersection of design and psychology.
            <br/><br/>Providing just the UI might draw your users attention at first but the looks are not what only matters. The feel of your application, the ease in navigation, the experience that the user gets is equally important.
            <br/><br/>Following are a few points one should remember to include in your designs for a better engagement.
            <br/>
        </p>
            <p><h2>1. Let The User Know Where He Is</h2>
            Consider yourself on an unknown road in an unknown city will you be able to find yourself the right destination of you didn't know exactly where you were? No, right. Similar is the case here, if you don't let your user know where exactly he/she is they will never find their destination and within a minuteâ€™s time you will have lost your user.
            So, how to let them know where they are? Well every good site uses a Navigation Bar. Highlight the primary and secondary menu tabs that are in use. Additionally, you can use
            <ol class ="list">
                <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>Status bar</li>
            </ol>
            This helps the user feel safe, as this shows them their entire trail of process and lets them go back to previous step. No one is perfect and neither are your users. They need an assurance that they can go back whenever they feel they made a mistake. Give them that trust.
            <br/><br/></p>
            <h2>2. Use A Call To Action Button</h2> 
        <p>A call to action button is important for the user to have clear direction for accomplishing the desired task. It makes it easier for the user to move easily through the process. How to do so? 
            <ol class ="list">
                <li> Use a slightly brighter color to grab the user's attention.</li>
                <li> Use large enough font to make it noticeable.</li>
                <li> Use action words or short phrases. Avoid using long sentences or phrases </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            
        <p><h2>3. Do No Underestimate The Power Of White Space</h2>
            Let the whitespace flow through your application. Whitespace improves readability and draws attention to the point of focus. Cluttered is chaos. Too much text, images, illustrations even too much use of colors kill the overall message and confuse the user.
            <br/>
            <br/></p>
            <h2>4. Know Your Typography</h2>
        <p>Use simple yet effective fonts. Too many fonts especially conflicting ones look disorganized. Try to stick to at the most three fonts unless you really need them badly.
            <br/>
            <br/></p>
            <h2>5. Compartmentalize And Balance Your Design</h2>
        <p>Grids are everywhere. Don't believe it? Look around they are everywhere- the buildings, the windows, the maps also city plans have grids as their foundation. Using grids in you website makes it look organized. They make it easier for the design to look consistent, proportional and unified.
